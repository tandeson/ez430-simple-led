KiCad Library Directories

These two directores are from the KiCad installation, under '<your KiCad Install>/share/library' and '<your KiCad Install>/share/modules'. Note that I didn't seperate out the items I added from the standard library items. If a item already exist in the standard library, then use KiCad's version.

Unfortuanlly  I don't remember where I added the new parts for the LED Visor.
